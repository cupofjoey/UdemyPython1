numbers = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
 #Not much to do here. Gotta be honest...just gonna...look around a bit. 
numbers[len(numbers) -1]
#output is '9'
numbers[3]
#output is '3'
#...ok...so....that's that. Zzzzzzzz. I'm sure it will get better I'm just in syntax hell right now. 
#Congrats if you're reading this. 
#Ok, lets do a loop, it's much better and fun anyway. 
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
#Let's print out any numbers in multiplied times themselves

for number in numbers:
    print(number**2)
